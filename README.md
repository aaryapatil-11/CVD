# CVD

Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a prevalent medical condition affecting millions globally, characterized by abnormalities in venous structure and function. Early detection and accurate classification of CVD stages are critical for timely intervention and effective treatment. The objective of this project is to develop an automated and reliable deep learning-based system for classifying various stages of Chronic Venous Disease using medical imaging data.
The methodology involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models highly effective for image classification tasks. The project utilizes a curated dataset of venous ultrasound or related medical images, preprocessed for noise reduction and normalization. The images are then fed into a CNN model trained to differentiate between healthy veins and various stages of CVD, including telangiectasia, varicose veins, and chronic venous insufficiency. The model architecture is optimized through techniques like dropout regularization, batch normalization, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Key findings from the project include the model's ability to achieve a high classification accuracy (over 90%) in distinguishing between different stages of CVD. The confusion matrix and evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score further validate the modelâ€™s robustness in handling class imbalances and complex features.
The tools and technologies used in this project include MATLAB for model development and image processing, along with its Deep Learning Toolbox for designing and training the CNN.
The final output is a functional prototype capable of classifying CVD stages from medical images, providing healthcare professionals with a decision-support tool for early diagnosis and better patient management.
